# Commit Message Template

Quality commit messages help maintainers understand the patch you fixed
or feature you added.

A good commit message looks like this:

```
Header line: explain the commit in one line (use the imperative form)

Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things in more detail,
possibly giving some background about the issue being fixed, etc.

The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and please
do proper word-wrap and keep columns at a maximum of about 89 characters.
That way, "git log" will show things nicely even when it's indented.

Make sure you explain your solution and why you're doing what you're doing,
as opposed to describing what you're doing. Reviewers and your future self can
read the patch, but might not understand why a particular solution was implemented.

Reported-by: who-ever-reported-it <mail@host.com>
Signed-off-by: Your Name <yourmail@yourhost.com>
```

The header line really should be meaningful, and really should be just one line.
That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and shortlog, and should
summarize the change in one readable line of text, independently of the longer
explanation. Please use verbs in the imperative in the commit message, as in
"Fix bug that ...", "Add file/feature ...", etc.
